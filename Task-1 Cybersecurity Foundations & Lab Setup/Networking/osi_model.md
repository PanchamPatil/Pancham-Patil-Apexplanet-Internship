# OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes how data is transmitted over a network in seven layers.

## 7 Layers of OSI Model

### 7. Application Layer
- Provides network services to end users
- Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS

### 6. Presentation Layer
- Data formatting, encryption, and compression
- Ensures data is readable by the application layer

### 5. Session Layer
- Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions
- Controls session checkpoints and recovery

### 4. Transport Layer
- Ensures reliable or unreliable data delivery
- Protocols: TCP, UDP

### 3. Network Layer
- Handles routing and logical addressing
- Protocols: IP, ICMP
- Devices: Routers

### 2. Data Link Layer
- Provides node-to-node data transfer
- Handles MAC addressing and error detection
- Devices: Switches

### 1. Physical Layer
- Transmits raw bits over physical medium
- Includes cables, signals, voltages

## Importance of OSI Model
- Helps understand network communication
- Assists in troubleshooting network issues
- Standard reference for network protocols

## Conclusion
The OSI model provides a structured approach to understanding how data flows across networks.
