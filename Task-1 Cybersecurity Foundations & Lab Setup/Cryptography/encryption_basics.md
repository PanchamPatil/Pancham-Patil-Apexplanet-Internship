# Cryptography & Encryption Basics

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by converting it into an unreadable format that can only be accessed by authorized parties.

---

## Why Cryptography is Important
- Protects sensitive data
- Ensures confidentiality
- Maintains data integrity
- Provides authentication
- Prevents unauthorized access

---

## Types of Encryption

### 1. Symmetric Encryption
- Uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption
- Faster and efficient
- Key sharing is a challenge

#### Examples:
- AES
- DES
- Blowfish

---

### 2. Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses two keys: Public key and Private key
- More secure but slower
- Used for secure key exchange

#### Examples:
- RSA
- ECC

---

## Hashing
Hashing converts data into a fixed-length value and is irreversible.

### Common Hashing Algorithms:
- MD5
- SHA-1
- SHA-256

### Uses of Hashing:
- Password storage
- Data integrity verification
- Digital signatures

---

## Digital Certificates & SSL/TLS
- Digital certificates verify the identity of websites
- SSL/TLS encrypts data transmitted over the network
- Used in HTTPS connections

---

## Cryptography in Cybersecurity
- Secure communications
- Secure authentication
- Data protection
- Secure online transactions

---

## Conclusion
Cryptography forms the backbone of modern cybersecurity by ensuring secure communication and data protection.
