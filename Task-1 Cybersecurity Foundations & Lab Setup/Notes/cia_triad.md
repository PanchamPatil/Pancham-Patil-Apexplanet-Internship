# CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity principles. It stands for:

## 1. Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals.

### Examples:
- Password protection
- Encryption
- Access control
- Two-factor authentication

### Threats to Confidentiality:
- Phishing
- Eavesdropping
- Insider threats

---

## 2. Integrity
Integrity ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage or transmission.

### Examples:
- Hashing (MD5, SHA-256)
- Digital signatures
- File permissions

### Threats to Integrity:
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Unauthorized data modification
- Malware

---

## 3. Availability
Availability ensures that systems, services, and data are accessible when needed.

### Examples:
- Regular system maintenance
- Backups
- Redundant systems

### Threats to Availability:
- DDoS attacks
- Hardware failures
- Power outages

---

## Conclusion
All three principles must be balanced. Weakness in one area can compromise overall security.
