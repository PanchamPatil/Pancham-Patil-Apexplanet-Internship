## Layers of TCP/IP Model

### 1. Application Layer
- Combines OSI layers: Application, Presentation, Session
- Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS

### 2. Transport Layer
- Responsible for end-to-end communication
- Protocols:
  - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
  - UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

### TCP vs UDP

| TCP | UDP |
|----|----|
| Reliable | Unreliable |
| Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| Slower | Faster |
| Error checking | No error checking |

### 3. Internet Layer
- Handles logical addressing and routing
- Protocols: IP, ICMP

### 4. Network Access Layer
- Physical transmission of data
- Includes Ethernet, Wi-Fi

## Importance of TCP/IP
- Backbone of the Internet
- Platform independent
- Highly scalable and reliable

---

## Conclusion
TCP/IP enables global communication and forms the foundation of modern networking.
